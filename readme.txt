Limit the length of your BuddyPress activity updates like Twitter

== Description ==

BP Limit Activity Length is a simple plugin that forces users to keep the length of their activity updates limited by amount of characters or words.

The plugin adds a character/word countdown next to the Post Update button, and prevents users from typing further than the specified limit. *Only new activities will be truncated to the set amount of characters or words*

The amount of characters is a simple setting in the BuddyPress administration screens.

== Installation ==

Install the plugin the usual way, then set the character limit (defaults to 140) in the BuddyPress settings screen (WP-Admin -> Settings -> BuddyPress -> Settings).
